            <h2>Life around river</h2>
            <p>As a river starts its life trickling down a mountainside, it experiments; trying new directions in search of the easiest path.

                Water follows the line of least resistance. A river charting its course - just like animals crossing a hillside or even people on their way to work has a story to tell.
                
                Last July, I joined an inspiring scientific expedition with the Geological Survey of Canada. We descended over 200km of the remote Coppermine River in the Canadian Arctic by canoe searching for evidence of early life.</p>
